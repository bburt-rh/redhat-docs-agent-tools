# Red Hat Docs Agent Tools

Follow the shared project conventions in @AGENTS.md for repository structure, skill naming, contributing rules, and general script invocation patterns. The instructions below apply only to Claude Code.

## Cross-skill script calls

When a command or agent calls a script that belongs to a different skill, use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-pr-reader/scripts/git_pr_reader.py info <url> --json
ruby ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dita-callouts/scripts/callouts.rb "$file"
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dita-includes/scripts/find_includes.sh "$file"
```

**Note for Cursor users:** If you use Cursor instead of Claude Code, see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for workspace-relative path guidance.

## Authoring skills, agents, and plugins — Anthropic documentation compliance

When creating or modifying skills, agents, hooks, or plugin components, follow the official Anthropic documentation. Do NOT rely on training data for schemas, frontmatter fields, or best practices — use WebFetch to consult the canonical docs listed below before generating any component.

### Canonical documentation references

Before creating any component, consult the relevant page:

| Component | Documentation |
|---|---|
| Skill authoring best practices | https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices.md |
| Skills overview and structure | https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview.md |
| Skills in Claude Code | https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills.md |
| Plugin schema and reference | https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference.md |
| Plugin creation guide | https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins.md |
| Subagents | https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents.md |
| Hooks | https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md |
| Tools reference | https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools-reference.md |
| CLAUDE.md and memory | https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory.md |
| Plugin marketplaces | https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces.md |

### Skill files

New skills must use the directory-based format: `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. The `commands/<name>.md` format is legacy and should not be used for new work. Existing commands continue to work.

For frontmatter fields, content guidelines, string substitution variables, and best practices, consult the canonical docs:
- https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills.md
- https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview.md
- https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices.md

### Agent files (subagents)

For the full subagent schema (required/optional frontmatter fields), consult https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents.md

Key behavioral constraints:
- The markdown body becomes the agent's system prompt — agents do NOT receive the full Claude Code system prompt
- Plugin agents cannot use `hooks`, `mcpServers`, or `permissionMode` frontmatter fields (these are ignored for security)
- Subagents cannot spawn other subagents

### Hooks

For valid event names, hook types, exit codes, and matchers, consult https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md

Project conventions:
- Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for all script paths in plugin hooks
- Scripts must be executable (`chmod +x`)

### Plugin structure

Required directory layout — components at plugin root, NOT inside `.claude-plugin/`:

```
my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Only manifest here
├── commands/                # At root level
├── skills/                  # At root level (skill-name/SKILL.md)
├── agents/                  # At root level
├── hooks/
│   └── hooks.json           # At root level
├── .mcp.json                # MCP server definitions
├── .lsp.json                # LSP server configurations
└── settings.json            # Default settings
```

For `plugin.json` schema (required/optional fields, component path overrides), consult https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference.md

All paths in plugin.json must be relative and start with `./`. Plugins cannot reference files outside their directory (no `../`).

### marketplace.json

For the marketplace schema (required fields, plugin entry format, source types), consult https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces.md

Version management: use semver (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) in `plugin.json` only — do not set version in `marketplace.json`. If version is unchanged, users will not receive updates due to caching.
