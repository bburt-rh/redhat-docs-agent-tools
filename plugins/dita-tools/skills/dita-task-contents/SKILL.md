# Task contents (Procedure title) skill

Add missing `.Procedure` block title to procedure modules for DITA compatibility.

## Overview

This skill uses the `task_contents.rb` Ruby script to find procedure modules that are missing the `.Procedure` block title and adds it before the first ordered list (the procedure steps).

## What it detects

The Vale rule `TaskContents.yml` detects procedure modules (files with `:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE`) that do not have a `.Procedure` or `..Procedure` block title.

## What it adds

### Missing .Procedure title

**Before:**
```asciidoc
:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="installing-software"]
= Installing the software

[role="_abstract"]
Install the software using the package manager.

.Prerequisites

* You have admin access.
* The repository is configured.

. Download the package.
. Run the installer.
. Verify the installation.
```

**After:**
```asciidoc
:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="installing-software"]
= Installing the software

[role="_abstract"]
Install the software using the package manager.

.Prerequisites

* You have admin access.
* The repository is configured.

.Procedure

. Download the package.
. Run the installer.
. Verify the installation.
```

## Why this matters

The `.Procedure` block title is required to properly map procedure steps to DITA task elements. Without it, the converter cannot identify where the task steps begin.

## Usage

When the user asks to fix procedure titles:

1. Identify the target folder or file containing AsciiDoc content
2. Find procedure modules (files with `:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE`)
3. Run the Ruby script against each file:
   ```bash
   ruby ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/task_contents.rb <file>
   ```
4. Report the changes made

### Dry run mode

To preview changes without modifying files:

```bash
ruby ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/task_contents.rb <file> --dry-run
```

### Output to different file

```bash
ruby ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/task_contents.rb <file> -o <output.adoc>
```

### Process all files in a directory

```bash
find <folder> -name "*.adoc" -exec ruby ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/task_contents.rb {} \;
```

## Example invocations

- "Add .Procedure titles to procedures in modules/"
- "Fix missing procedure markers in the getting_started folder"
- "Add .Procedure block title to all procedure files"
- "Preview procedure title changes in modules/ --dry-run"

## Behavior notes

- **Only processes procedures**: Files without `:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE` are skipped
- **Skips existing titles**: Files that already have `.Procedure` are not modified
- **Finds first ordered list**: The `.Procedure` title is inserted before the first ordered list after any Prerequisites section
- **Handles Prerequisites**: If a Prerequisites section exists, the script inserts after it
- **Skips code blocks**: Ordered lists inside code blocks are not considered

## Output format

```
<file>: Added .Procedure title before line N
```

Or:

```
<file>: .Procedure title already exists
```

Or:

```
<file>: Not a procedure module (skipped)
```

Or:

```
<file>: No ordered list found for procedure steps
```

## Extension location

The Ruby script is located at: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/task_contents.rb`
