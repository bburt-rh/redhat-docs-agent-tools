description: Validate documentation technical accuracy against code repositories. Detects removed commands, changed API signatures, stale code examples, renamed config keys, and moved file paths. Auto-fixes high-confidence issues (>=65%) and generates a report for manual review of the rest. Use this skill when asked to check if docs match the code, verify CLI examples still work, validate API references, find outdated commands or stale documentation, compare docs against a PR or JIRA ticket, or run a technical review. Also use when the user says things like "are these docs accurate" or "check the code examples".

# Technical Review Skill

Validate documentation for technical accuracy by comparing against source code repositories. Automatically fixes high-confidence issues and generates detailed reports for manual review.

## Purpose

This skill validates documentation against actual code to catch:
- **Removed components** - Commands, functions, or APIs documented but no longer in code
- **Syntax changes** - Command flags, function signatures, or API endpoints that changed
- **Conceptual inaccuracies** - Descriptions that don't match code behavior
- **Configuration errors** - Invalid keys, incorrect defaults, or wrong value types
- **Stale examples** - Code snippets that no longer compile or run

## Workflow Overview

This skill implements **Phase 1** of the technical review workflow. It validates docs, auto-fixes high-confidence issues (>=65%), and generates a report. Phase 2 (interactive apply of lower-confidence fixes) is handled by the `docs-technical-review-apply` skill.

Auto-fixable issues (>=65% confidence) include renamed command flags, updated function signatures, changed API endpoints, renamed config keys, and whitespace corrections.

## Input Modes

### Mode 1: Explicit Code Repositories

```bash
/docs-technical-review-validate --docs modules/ \
  --code https://github.com/org/repo1 \
  --code https://github.com/org/repo2 \
  --fix
```

Specify code repositories directly. Validates all documentation files against these repos.

### Mode 2: Auto-Discovery from JIRA

```bash
/docs-technical-review-validate --docs .claude_docs/drafts/rhaistrat-123/ \
  --jira RHAISTRAT-123 \
  --fix
```

**Discovery process**:
1. Fetch JIRA ticket using `jira-reader` skill
2. Extract linked PR/MR URLs from ticket
3. Parse PR/MR descriptions for repository references
4. Fall back to JIRA description for repo mentions
5. Extract repo URLs and default to `main` branch

### Mode 3: Auto-Discovery from PRs

```bash
/docs-technical-review-validate --docs modules/ \
  --pr https://github.com/org/repo/pull/456 \
  --pr https://gitlab.com/org/project/-/merge_requests/789 \
  --fix
```

### Mode 4: Auto-Discovery from Google Docs

```bash
/docs-technical-review-validate --docs modules/ \
  --gdoc https://docs.google.com/document/d/ABC123 \
  --fix
```

### Mode 5: Combined Discovery

```bash
/docs-technical-review-validate \
  --docs .claude_docs/drafts/rhaistrat-123/ \
  --jira RHAISTRAT-123 \
  --pr https://github.com/org/repo/pull/456 \
  --code https://github.com/org/other-repo \
  --fix
```

Combines all discovery methods, deduplicates repository URLs, validates against all sources.

### Mode 6: AsciiDoc Attribute Fallback

If no repos specified and auto-discovery finds nothing, searches for `:code-repo-url:` attributes in AsciiDoc files:

```asciidoc
:code-repo-url: https://github.com/org/repo
:code-repo-ref: v2.0.0
```

## Implementation Workflow

Follow this exact workflow when invoked:

### Step 1: Parse Arguments

The calling command (or user) provides these arguments. Extract them from the invocation context:

- `--docs SOURCE` (required, repeatable) — documentation to validate
- `--code URL` (repeatable) — code repository URL
- `--ref BRANCH` (default: main) — git ref for previous `--code`
- `--jira TICKET-123` — JIRA ticket for auto-discovery
- `--pr URL` (repeatable) — PR/MR URL for auto-discovery
- `--gdoc URL` — Google Doc URL for auto-discovery
- `--fix` — enable auto-fixing (>=65% confidence)
- `--auto` — run both phases without pausing
- `--dry-run` — show what would be fixed without applying changes

### Step 1b: Resolve Docs Sources

Each `--docs` source is auto-detected and resolved:

| Source Type | Detection | Resolution |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Local file | Path exists as file | Use directly |
| Local directory | Path exists as directory | Glob for `*.adoc` and `*.md` files |
| Glob pattern | Contains `*` or `?` | Expand pattern to matching files |
| PR/MR URL | Matches GitHub/GitLab PR URL pattern | Fetch changed doc files via `git_review_api.py` |
| Google Doc URL | Matches `docs.google.com` | Read via `docs-convert-gdoc-md` skill, save to temp file |
| Remote repo URL | Matches `https://github.com` or `https://gitlab.com` (non-PR) | Clone and glob for doc files |

Collect all resolved files into `DOCS_FILES` array for validation.

### Step 2: Validate Input

Verify at least one `--docs` source was provided and at least one code repository was specified or discovered. If either is missing, stop with a clear error message listing the available options.

### Step 3: Clone Code Repositories

Clone each repo to `/tmp/tech-review/<repo-name>/` using `git clone --depth 1`. Try the specified `--ref` first, fall back to default branch. Skip repos that are already cloned. Warn and continue if a clone fails.

### Parallelization

When multiple code repositories are involved, parallelize the extract+search pipeline across repos using subagents. Each repo's pipeline (Steps 4-5) is independent and can run concurrently. Merge results before proceeding to Step 6 (whole-repo scan).

For single-repo reviews, run sequentially — the overhead of subagent spawning isn't worth it.

### Step 4: Extract Technical References

Run the `extract_tech_references.rb` script from this skill's `scripts/` directory. It parses AsciiDoc and Markdown files to identify commands, code blocks, APIs/functions, configuration keys, and file paths, outputting structured JSON.

```bash
SKILL_SCRIPTS="$(dirname "$0")/../skills/docs-technical-review-validate/scripts"
REFS_JSON="/tmp/tech-review-refs.json"

ruby "$SKILL_SCRIPTS/extract_tech_references.rb" \
  "${DOCS_FILES[@]}" \
  --output "$REFS_JSON"
```

If the script path cannot be resolved, search for `extract_tech_references.rb` using Glob to locate it.

### Step 5: Search and Validate References Against Code

Run the `search_tech_references.rb` script from this skill's `scripts/` directory. Pass all cloned repo paths as positional arguments after the refs JSON:

```bash
ruby "$SKILL_SCRIPTS/search_tech_references.rb" \
  "$REFS_JSON" \
  "$CLONE_DIR/repo1" "$CLONE_DIR/repo2" \
  --output /tmp/tech-review-search.json
```

The script searches each repository for matches against every extracted reference.

**Search results by category**:

| Category | Result Fields | What It Finds |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Commands** | `found`, `found_path`, `flags_missing`, `similar_commands`, `git_log_mentions` | Whether command binary/script exists, which flags are missing, git history for renames |
| **Code Blocks** | `match_type` (exact/partial/none), `match_ratio`, `matched_file`, `actual_code` | Exact or fuzzy content matches in source files of the matching language |
| **APIs/Functions** | `definition_found`, `actual_signature`, `type` (function/class/endpoint) | Function/class/endpoint definitions and whether signatures match |
| **Configuration** | `key_found`, `found_in_file`, `git_log_mentions` | Whether config keys exist in schema/example files, git history for renames |
| **File Paths** | `exists`, `moved_to`, `similar_files` | Whether referenced paths exist, fuzzy matches if file was moved |

**Interpreting results and assigning confidence**:

The search results are raw evidence — use your judgment to interpret them and assign confidence scores. The key principle: confidence reflects how certain you are about both the problem and the fix, not just the problem.

- **Exact matches** with only syntax/formatting differences → high confidence (>=85%), because the fix is obvious
- **Git log evidence** of renames or deprecation → medium-high (70-90%), because the history confirms intentional change
- **Partial matches** or similar-but-different results → medium (50-64%), because the right fix is ambiguous
- **No matches at all** → low (<50%), because it could be removal OR wrong repo OR the reference is fine but lives elsewhere
- **Context matters**: a missing flag in a command that otherwise exists is higher confidence than a completely missing command, because you know the command is right and only the flag changed

Cross-reference multiple signals (search results + git history + related files) before finalizing confidence.

**Assigning severity**: `High` = users will hit errors (broken commands, missing APIs). `Medium` = misleading but not blocking (wrong names, stale options). `Low` = cosmetic or informational (undocumented features, formatting).

### Step 6: Perform Whole-Repo Scanning

For each flagged issue (removed command, changed API, etc.), search all `.adoc` and `.md` files for additional occurrences of the same pattern. Record every file and line where the pattern appears so the report captures the full blast radius.

### Step 7: Apply Auto-Fixes (if --fix enabled)

For each issue with confidence >=65%, apply the fix using the Edit tool. Track each fix applied and its before/after text for the report.

### Step 8: Generate Markdown Report

Generate comprehensive markdown report at `.claude_docs/technical-review-report.md` with these sections:

1. **Header** - docs sources, timestamp, repo count
2. **Summary table** - per-category counts (validated, issues, auto-fixed, manual review)
3. **Code Repositories** - URL, ref, source, clone path for each repo
4. **Issues Auto-Fixed** - each with ID (`AF-N`), location, issue, evidence, and diff
5. **Issues Requiring Manual Review** - each with ID (`MR-N`), location, severity, issue, evidence, suggested diff, reasoning, and agentic action command
6. **Whole-Repo Scan Results** - grouped by issue type, listing all files/lines affected
7. **Next Steps** - review auto-fixes, run Phase 2, address whole-repo findings, run Vale, test examples
8. **Agentic Follow-Up Command** - example `/docs-technical-review-apply` invocations

### Step 8b: Generate JSON Sidecar Report

Write `.claude_docs/technical-review-report.json` alongside the markdown report. This structured output enables programmatic consumption by Phase 2 and CI/CD pipelines.

**Format**: Array of issue objects:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "AF-1",
    "file": "modules/proc-install.adoc",
    "line": 42,
    "category": "commands",
    "confidence": 90,
    "old_text": "--enable-feature",
    "new_text": "--feature-enable",
    "evidence": "Flag renamed in commit abc123",
    "description": "Command flag renamed in v2.0",
    "severity": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Git log shows flag renamed in v2.0 release"
  },
  {
    "id": "MR-1",
    "file": "modules/ref-api.adoc",
    "line": 18,
    "category": "apis",
    "confidence": 55,
    "old_text": "getUserProfile(id)",
    "new_text": "getProfile(userId)",
    "evidence": "Function signature changed, similar function found",
    "description": "API function signature may have changed",
    "severity": "High",
    "reasoning": "Similar function getProfile exists but takes userId instead of id — may be a rename or a different function"
  }
]
```

**Fields**:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Issue ID (`AF-N` for auto-fixed, `MR-N` for manual review) |
| `file` | string | Path to the documentation file |
| `line` | number | Line number in the file |
| `category` | string | One of: `commands`, `code_blocks`, `apis`, `configs`, `file_paths`, `conceptual` |
| `confidence` | number | Confidence score (0-100) |
| `old_text` | string | Original text in the documentation (enables content-based matching in Phase 2) |
| `new_text` | string | Suggested or applied replacement text |
| `evidence` | string | What was found in the code repository |
| `description` | string | Human-readable description of the issue |
| `severity` | string | Issue severity: `High`, `Medium`, or `Low` |
| `reasoning` | string | Explanation of why the change is suggested and confidence rationale |

The `old_text` field is critical for Phase 2: it enables content-based matching to locate issues even if line numbers have shifted due to earlier edits.

### Step 9: Output Summary

Display a summary showing total issues found, auto-fixed count, manual review count, and the paths to both report files.

## Error Handling

- **No repos discovered**: Exit with error, show discovery methods
- **Clone failures**: Warn and skip repo, continue with others
- **No references found**: Exit gracefully, report summary
- **Invalid AsciiDoc**: Report errors but continue processing
- **Git command failures**: Catch and report, do not crash

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill can be called by:
- `docs-technical-review` command (orchestrates Phase 1 + Phase 2)
- `docs-workflow` command (as optional Stage 5)
- CI/CD pipelines for automated validation
